Angel Chronicles game made in Unity, as a project for the Project II university course.

The goal of this project was to develop a full Unity game, along with shaders also developed by us.
We decided to implement a Puzzle-Platformer game, with toon shading.

This was a university group project made by:
- João Soares https://github.com/joao13soares
- Luís Silva https://github.com/oceanncs
- Paulo Macedo https://github.com/Pauloamm
- Fábio Silva https://github.com/fabiodanil2
