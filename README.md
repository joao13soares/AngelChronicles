Angel Chronicles game made in Unity, as a project for the Project II university course.

The goal of this project was to develop a full Unity game, along with shaders also developed by us.
We decided to implement a Puzzle-Platformer game, with toon shading.
The player takes the role of an Angel who can't fly and has to collect feathers, face enemies, use special mechanics and reach the aureola at the end of each level.

This game and its mechanics were heavily inspired by other games of similar genres, like Klonoa: Door to Phantomile, Rayman 2: The Great Escape, Spyro, and Super Mario Galaxy.

This was a university group project made by:
